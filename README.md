## Description
Our aim is to build a graph-based network of the co-usage, understood as being cited by the same scientific publication, of research software found in OpenEBench, in order to provide guidance on scientific workflows worth benchmarking. Once this graph-based is built, different network analysis techniques will be applied to identify specific communities, which would map to specific scientific domains, as well as to the existence of well-defined and widely used scientific workflows.

## Databases

- GraphPerYear: Create a graph with the edges as co-occurences per year.
- OpenAccessGraph: Graph of the OpenAccess publications.
